### StratX Investing

Trading system. Many trading bots have been developed with flexible settings for each instrument.

Bot functionality

- Increase/Decrease positions

UI functionality
- Creating/Editing strategies
- Multiple Creation/Editing of strategies

This high-load project includes many microservices, since algorithmic and neural pointers require fast calculations.
Each microservice takes up 50-100 MB of memory; optimally, each bot can be loaded with up to 1000 clients, then the bot begins to scale horizontally.

We also developed our own interfaces for integration with exchanges, since from what we have it works slowly (request on average from 1 second),
which is sometimes extremely catastrophic, we were able to increase the request speed to 100ms, which is already better.
