### Super Gas Bras

The project is implemented under the brand Pvinova.

The main objective of the project is to optimize the time of gas filling stations.

Customers can indicate the time for which they want to arrive and the number of cylinders p13 for refueling.
Each gas station has its own settings.
The site maintains statistics on refilled cylinders, refueling times, and deviations from the norm.
For the main screen at the gas station, there is an air panel so that customers are aware of the current state of the gas station.
