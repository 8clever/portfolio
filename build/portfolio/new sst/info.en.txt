Not a great web service for installing / updating / removing modules in a car.
The client can request it from the service, the operator will check, the employee will do it.
There is a warehouse service. By warehouse service, you can track the module. The module can be in the car, at the supplier’s warehouse or at the mechanic’s warehouse.
Tracking modules is the main reason for creating this project.
