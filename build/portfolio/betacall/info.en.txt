https://niti.betacall4all.ru

Web application for automatic customer call.

The system calls customers by orders. If the customer got through, the call is transferred to the operator and the order opens automatically.
The operator only has to confirm the delivery conditions, or cancel the order.
With this system, the call center bandwidth has increased 3 times, since operators do not spend time waiting for a connection with the client if it is not responding or is not available.
Also, the system makes parallel calls in order to increase the chance of a successful dial-up so that the operator does not waste time in vain.
